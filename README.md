# 👋 Hey — I'm Rishish Pradhan

**Figure-it-out mindset. If it matters, I’ll build it, automate it, or power it with AI — and make it work.**

I’m a generalist engineer with a bias for action — I learn fast, build end-to-end, and ship things that work in the real world.

- 🧠 Automation • Testing • Backend Logic • Systems Thinking  
- ⚡ Solo-builder mindset — apps, workflows, growth systems, content engines  
- 🤖 Using AI + tools to work faster, smarter, and with better leverage

## 🚀 What I Love Building
